                <p>Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to 
                    improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and
                     childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and
                      cardiovascular disease), and longevity.  <br>
                      Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to
                       improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth,
                       lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Moderate amounts of fats and oils are part of a healthy diet. Fats and oils are
                        concentrated sources of energy, and eating too much fat, particularly the wrong 
                        kinds of fat, can be harmful to health. For example, people who eat too much saturated 
                        fat and trans-fat are at higher risk of heart disease and stroke. Trans-fat may occur
                         naturally in certain meat and milk products, but the industrially produced trans-fat 
                         (e.g. partially hydrogenated oils) present in various processed foods is the main source.
                            Use unsaturated vegetable oils (e.g. olive, soy, sunflower or corn oil) rather than 
                            animal’s fats or oils high in 
                            saturated fats (e.g. butter, ghee, lard, coconut and palm oil).
                        When possible, choose white meat (e.g. poultry) and fish, which are generally low in fats, rather than
                        red meat. <br> <br>
                         Eat only limited amounts of processed meats because these are high in fat and salt. Try also to opt
                        for low-fat or reduced fat versions of milk and dairy products. Avoid processed, baked and fried foods that
                        contain industrially produced trans-fat.
                        People whose diets are high in sodium (including salt) have a greater risk of high blood
                         pressure, which can increase their risk of heart disease and stroke. Similarly, those
                          whose diets are high in sugars have a greater risk of becoming overweight or obese,
                           and an increased risk of tooth decay. People who reduce the amount of sugars in their
                            diet may also reduce their risk of no communicable diseases such as heart disease and
                             stroke. <br> <br>
                        When cooking and preparing foods, limit the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments
                        (e.g. soy sauce and fish sauce). Also, try to avoid foods like snacks that are high in salt and sugars.
                        Limit intake of soft drinks or soda and other drinks that are high in sugars (e.g. fruit juices, cordials
                        and syrups, flavoured milks and yogurt drinks), and choose fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as
                            cookies, cakes and chocolate <br>

        <h1>Mulnutrition</h1>
        <div class="text"></div>
        <p>Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a
             person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition addresses 3 broad groups of conditions:</p>
         <br>
             <h2>Various forms of malnutrition</h2>
          
          <h4>Under Nutrition</h4>
          <br>
          <p>There are 4 broad sub-forms of under nutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight, and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. Under nutrition makes children in particular much more vulnerable to disease and death.
            Low weight-for-height is known as wasting. It usually indicates recent and severe weight loss, because a person has not had enough food to eat and/or they have had an infectious disease, such as diarrhoea, which has caused them to lose weight. A young child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible.
            Low height-for-age is known as stunting. It is the result of chronic or recurrent under nutrition, usually associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness, and/or inappropriate infant and young child feeding and care in early life. Stunting holds children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential.
            Children with low weight-for-age are known as underweight. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted, or both.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Micronutrient-related malnutrition</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Inadequacies in intake of vitamins and minerals often referred to as micronutrients, can also be grouped together. Micronutrients enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones, and other substances that are essential for proper growth and development.
                Iodine, vitamin A, and iron are the most important in global public health terms; their deficiency represents a major threat to the health and development of populations worldwide, particularly children and pregnant women in low-income countries.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>overweight and Obacity</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Overweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Abnormal or excessive fat accumulation can impair health.
                    Body mass index (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify overweight and obesity. It is defined as a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m²). In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, whereas obesity is a BMI of 30 or more.
                    Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between energy consumed (too much) and energy expended (too little). Globally, people are consuming foods and drinks that are more energy-dense (high in sugars and fats), and engaging in less physical activity.
